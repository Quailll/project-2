# SNEAKS

## Description

This application is a platform where users can share their passion and love for shoes. Our application's first step is for users to signup and/or login into their accounts so they can post shoes and see a feed of shoes. Each user will have their own collection and they can update their shoe collection everytime they post. When the user post/updates their collection, the post will be shared in a global feed where other users will be able to view the post.
